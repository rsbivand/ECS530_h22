The best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according to the distribution of a data variable. The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

abstract="Functions to calculate measures of spatial association, especially measures of spatial autocorrelation, have been made available in many software applications. Measures may be global, applying to the whole data set under consideration, or local, applying to each observation in the data set. Methods of statistical inference may also be provided, but these will, like the measures themselves, depend on the support of the observations, chosen assumptions, and the way in which spatial association is represented; spatial weights are often used as a representational technique. In addition, assumptions may be made about the underlying mean model, and about error distributions. Different software implementations may choose to expose these choices to the analyst, but the sets of choices available may vary between these implementations, as may default settings. This comparison will consider the implementations of global Moran's I, Getis--Ord G and Geary's C, local {\$}{\$}I{\_}i{\$}{\$}Iiand {\$}{\$}G{\_}i{\$}{\$}Gi, available in a range of software including Crimestat, GeoDa, ArcGIS, PySAL and R contributed packages.",

To complement this situation, spatial scientists need good approximations of eigenvalues for irregular tessellations. Starting from known or approximated extreme eigenvalues, the remaining eigenvalues may be in turn approximated. One reason spatial scientists are interested in eigenvalues is because they are needed to calculate the Jacobian term in the autonormal probability model. If eigenvalues are not needed for model fitting, good approximations are needed to give the interval within which the spatial parameter will lie."

The proposed estimator relies on the approximation of the likelihood function, that follows a multivariate normal distribution which parameters depend on the spatial structure of the observations. The approximation is inspired by the univariate conditioning procedure proposed by Mendell and Elston, with some modifications to improve accuracy and speed. Very accurate parameter estimations have been achieved in reasonable time for simulated data samples with as much as one million observations. The lessons learned in the Monte Carlo experiment have been applied to a case study on urban sprawl over more than forty thousands plots in Southern France."

   approaches, a simulation of 250 CARs of 2,905 observations can take
   fewer than three minutes on a personal computer, despite the necessity
   of evaluating 100 determinants of 2,905 by 2,905 matrices. The
   computation of each estimate via examining the profile likelihood
   sampled at 100 points avoids problems of local optima. Simulating
   estimates avoids other problems associated with the traditional

Abstract = {{Spatial estimators usually require the manipulation of n(2) relations
   among n observations and use operations such as determinants,
   eigenvalues, and inverses whose operation counts grow at a rate
   proportional to n(3). This paper provides ways to quickly compute
   estimates when the dependent variable follows a spatial autoregressive
   process, which by appropriate specification of the independent
   variables can subsume the case when the errors follow a spatial
   autoregressive process. Since only nearby observations fend to affect a
   given observation, most observations have no effect and hence the
   spatial weight matrix becomes sparse. By exploiting sparsity and
   rearranging computations, one can compute estimates at low cost. As a
   demonstration of the efficacy of these techniques, the paper provides a
   Monte Carlo study whereby 3,107 observation regressions require only
   0.1 seconds each when using Matlab on a 200 Mhz Pentium Pro personal
   computer. In addition, the paper illustrates these techniques by
   examining voting behavior across U.S. counties in the 1980 presidential
   election.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial estimators usually provide lower prediction errors than their

   a large number of operations. Fortunately, for a given observation only
   a relatively small number of nearby observations typically exhibit
   correlated errors. This means that most of the elements of the n by n
   spatial matrices are zero. The use of sparse matrix techniques can
   dramatically lower storage requirements and reduce execution times. In

   which avoids the necessity of evaluating an n by n determinant. This

In addition, this bias is shown to be present in general Moran tests of spatial dependency. Thus, positive dependencies may often fail to be detected when weight matrices are strongly connected. The analysis begins with a detailed examination of downward bias for the extreme case of maximally connected weight matrices. Results for this case are then extended by continuity to a broader range of (appropriately defined) strongly connected matrices. Finally, a simulated numerical example is presented to illustrate some of the practical consequences of these biases.},

Under the presence of missing data, estimation is not straightforward, due to the implied dependence of all units. The EM algorithm is the standard approach to accomplish ML estimation in this case. An alternative approach is considered, the method of maximising the marginal likelihood. At first glance the method is computationally complex due to inversion of large matrices that are of the same size as the complete data, but these can be avoided, leading to an algorithm that is usually much faster than the EM algorithm and without typical EM convergence issues. Another approximate method is also proposed that serves as an alternative, for example when the contiguity matrix is dense. The methods are illustrated using a well known data set on house prices with 25,357 units."
