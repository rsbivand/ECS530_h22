# ECS530 Autumn 2022
NHH ECS530 2022 course: Spatial data analysis (with R)

A PhD-level course in spatial data analysis will be held 14-18 November 2022 in Bergen, Norway (quasi-hybrid format):

Three short "flipped" two-hour sessions were held Tuesdays 09:00-12:00 CEST September 20 and October 4 and 18 on-line for remote participants (these will be based on own study); a consultation slot November 1 (09:00-12:00 CET) was held to suggest topics for the intensive week, and to firm up project ideas. Intensive follow-up sessions will follow on-site in November permitting interaction between participants.

External participants should have applied using this form before the 1 September deadline to permit processing before the first short session:

For further details see the course page; participants must cover their own travel and living costs; no support is offered, I'm afraid, apart from free tuition.
